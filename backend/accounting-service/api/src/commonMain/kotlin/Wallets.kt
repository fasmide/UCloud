            Wallets hold allocations which grant access to a provider's resources.

            $TYPE_REF Wallet s are the core abstraction used in the accounting system of UCloud. This feature builds
            on top of various other features of UCloud. Here is a quick recap:

            - The users of UCloud are members of 
              [Workspaces and Projects](/docs/developer-guide/accounting-and-projects/projects/projects.md). These form 
              the foundation of all collaboration in UCloud.
            - UCloud is an orchestrator of $Resource s. UCloud delegates the responsibility of hosting $Resource s to 
              $Provider s.
            - $Provider s define which services they support using $TYPE_REF Product s.
            - All $TYPE_REF Product s belong in a $TYPE_REF ProductCategory . The category contains similar 
              $TYPE_REF Product s. Under normal circumstances, all products in a category run on the same system.
            - $TYPE_REF Product s define a payment model. The model supports quotas (`DIFFERENTIAL_QUOTA`), one-time 
              payments and periodic payments (`ABSOLUTE`). All absolute payment models support paying in a 
              product-specific unit or in DKK.
            - All $TYPE_REF Product s in a category share the exact same payment model

            Allocators grant access to $Resource s via $TYPE_REF WalletAllocation s. In a simplified view, an 
            allocation is:

            - An initial balance, specified in the "unit of allocation" which the $TYPE_REF Product specifies. 
              For example: 1000 DKK or 500 Core Hours.
            - Start date and optional end date.
            - An optional parent allocation.
            - A current balance, the balance remaining for this allocation and all descendants.
            - A local balance, the balance remaining if it had no descendants

            UCloud combines allocations of the same category into a $TYPE_REF Wallet. Every $TYPE_REF Wallet has 
            exactly one owner, [a workspace](/docs/developer-guide/accounting-and-projects/projects/projects.md). 
            $TYPE_REF Wallet s create a natural hierarchical structure. Below we show an example of this:

            The accounting system of UCloud has three core operations.

            The three core operations of the UCloud accounting system are:

            - $CALL_REF accounting.charge: Records usage in the system. For absolute payment models, this will deduct 
              the balance and local balance of an allocation. All ancestor allocations have their balance deducted by 
              the same amount. The local balances of an ancestor remains unchanged. 
            - $CALL_REF accounting.deposit: Creates a new _sub-allocation_ from a parent allocation. The new allocation
              will have the current allocation as a parent. The balance of the parent allocation is not changed.
            - $CALL_REF accounting.transfer: Creates a new root allocation from a parent allocation. The new allocation 
              will have no parents. The balance of the parent allocation is immediately removed, in full.

                Internal UCloud services invoke this endpoint to record usage from a workspace. Providers report data 
                indirectly to this API through the outgoing `Control` API. This endpoint causes changes in the balances 
                of the targeted allocation and ancestors. UCloud will change the `balance` and `localBalance` property 
                of the targeted allocation. Ancestors of the targeted allocation will only update their `balance`.

                UCloud returns a boolean, for every request, indicating if the charge was successful. A charge is 
                successful if no affected allocation went into a negative balance.

                ---

                The semantics of `charge` depends on the Product's payment model.

                __Absolute:__

                - UCloud calculates the change in balances by multiplying: the Product's pricePerUnit, the number of 
                  units, the number of periods
                - UCloud subtracts this change from the balances

                __Differential:__

                - UCloud calculates the change in balances by comparing the units with the current `localBalance`
                - UCloud subtracts this change from the balances
                - Note: This change can cause the balance to go up, if the usage is lower than last period

                #### Selecting Allocations

                The charge operation targets a wallet (by combining the ProductCategoryId and WalletOwner). This means 
                that the charge operation have multiple allocations to consider. We explain the approach for absolute 
                payment models. The approach is similar for differential products.

                UCloud first finds a set of leaf allocations which, when combined, can carry the full change. UCloud 
                first finds a set of candidates. We do this by sorting allocations by the Wallet's `chargePolicy`. By 
                default, this means that UCloud prioritizes allocations that expire soon. UCloud only considers 
                allocations which are active and have a positive balance.

                ---

                __📝 NOTE:__ UCloud does not consider ancestors at this point in the process.
                
                ---

                UCloud now creates the list of allocations which it will use. We do this by performing a rolling sum of 
                the balances. UCloud adds an allocation to the set if the rolling sum has not yet reached the total 
                amount.

                UCloud will use the full balance of each selected allocation. The only exception is the last element, 
                which might use less. If the change in balance is never reached, then UCloud will further charge the 
                first selected allocation. In this case, the priority allocation will have to pay the difference.

                Finally, the system updates the balances of each selected leaf, and all of their ancestors.
