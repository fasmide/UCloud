group User Creation (SAML2 flow)
u -> uc: Login with WAYF
uc ->ucidp: Start auth (SAML2)
ucidp --> uc: Redirect to IdP
uc --> u: Redirect to IdP
u -> ucidp: Authentication
ucidp --> u: OK Redirect to UCloud/Core
u -> uc: Auth tokens
uc -> uc: Create user
uc --> u: Welcome EndUser#1234
end

group Requesting Resources (Grants)
u -> uc: Apply for Resources
uc --> u: Please select affiliation
u -> uc: Select DeiC Interactive HPC
uc --> u: Grant application form
u -> uc: Grant application
uc --> u: OK
uc-->> ga: Notify new application
ga -> uc: Approved
uc --> ga: OK
uc -->> u: Notify approved\n**⚠️ Missing connection!**
uc -->> im: Notify approved\n**XXX DKK approved for ProjectFoo**
end

group Optional: Provisioning Resources
note over im: The approval notification from UCloud/Core\ncontains all the relevant information about the\ngrant. Providers can optionally prepare these\nresources now.
note over im: The notification also contains information about\nthe project itself. It contains information such as\nmembership, groups and internal roles.
note over im: However, the end-user has not yet performed any\ntype of connection. Thus the provider might choose\nto wait before allocating resources.
im->slurm: Prepare accounts
slurm --> im: OK
im->fs: Prepare storage
fs-->im: OK
end

group Connecting with Provider (OpenID Connect Flow)
u -> uc: Initiate connection with Provider
uc -> im: EndUser#1234 wishes to connect

uc ->oidc: Start auth (OIDC)
oidc --> im: Redirect to IdP
im --> uc: Redirect to IdP
uc --> u: Redirect to IdP
u -> oidc: Authenticate
oidc -> idp: << Auth protocol >>
idp --> oidc: << Auth protocol >>
note over oidc,idp: The authentication is either\n directly with the OIDC provider\nor some delegate (e.g. FreeIPA)
note over oidc,idp: The integration module has no\nknowledge of the specifics in this step.\n**It is a black-box.**
note over idp,oidc: Authentication protocol is up to\nOIDC provider/IdP. This can include\nmultiple factors and hardware keys.
oidc --> u: OK Redirect to Integration Module
u -> im: Auth tokens
im -> im: Verify and register mapping\n(EndUser#1234 = 512314)
note over im: OIDC tokens are verified using the\nRSA public key of the OIDC provider
im --> u: OK Redirect to UCloud
im -->> uc: Notify connection complete for\nEndUser#1234
end

group Optional: Provisioning Resources
note over im: At this point, the integration module may\nalso choose to perform initialization of\nresources. This is beneficial since UID\nof local users is now available.
im -> slurm: Allocate resources
slurm --> im: OK
end

group Project Management
u -> uc: Add user Alice#1234 to ProjectFoo
uc --> u: OK
uc -->> im: One or more project updates pending
im -> uc: Fetch project updates
uc --> im: ProjectFoo updated (full state)
note over im: The integration module calculates its own diff.\nThis helps protect against missed events while\nthe provider is down (but UCloud isn't).
im -> im: Calculate project diff

note over im: Each diff event is dispatches to one or more\nextensions. Each extension is responsible\nfor handling a concrete type of event.

group Project created extension
im -> im: Invoke project created extension
note over im,idp: ""/* Simplified extension payload */\n{"newProject":{"localId": 41005,"project":{"specification":{"title": "ProjectFoo"}}}}""
im -> idp: Create group with GID ""41005"" and name ""ProjectFoo_41005""
idp --> im: OK
end

group User added extension
im -> im: Invoke user added extension
note over im,idp:""/* Simplified extension payload */\n{\n   "newMembers": [{ "uid": 78514, "projectMember": { "username": "Alice#1234", "role": "USER" } } ]\n   "newProject": { "localId": 41005, "project": { ... } }\n}""
im -> idp: Add user with UID ""78514"" to group with GID ""41005""
idp --> im: OK
